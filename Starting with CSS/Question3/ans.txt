We can set opacity to any section of our form in two ways:

1. Using selctor: By using selector we can mention opacity attribute and set its value between 0 and 1.
                  
                  Example: Selector{
                    opacity:0.5;
                  }

2. By RGBA value : By using rgba value also we can set its last parameter i.e. A that represents audacity/
                   opacity between 0 to 1 according to our prefrence.
