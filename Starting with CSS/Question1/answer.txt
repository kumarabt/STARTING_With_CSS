When we target a same element in our html file using inline, internal and external css then the inline
css will the utmost priority and then second most priority is given to the internal css and lastly
external css has the least priority.

But it is considered to be best practise at industry level to use external css by linking it to your
html file as you can seprately work on the styling part in big projects.
